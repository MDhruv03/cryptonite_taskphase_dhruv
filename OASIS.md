# BasiKELLY

## Approach

Had to check various decoders and in the end it was simple base 32 conversion.

# Key-Key do you love me?

## Approach

Took around 90 minutes of pleading in order for the bot to give up the flag but all in vain. At last, the threat of murdering the kittens somehow turned up successful.
Then the command to retrieve the flag was given and then the flag.

# Maze Runner

## Approach

Had to search up this image and after some quick reading of a couple articles, it was found that the ideator was the friend of the artist and simple destination and surname got the flag.

# Git Gud

## Approach

Normal github file folder. Took a while but finally the flag was in the master directory in vertical order.

# I have been falling for 30 minutes!

## Approach

Had to be clever about this one as it required simple change in the link from userid=5 to userid=6 which revealed the flag.
